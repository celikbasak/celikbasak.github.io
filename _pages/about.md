Hi there! This is Basak, a fourth year PhD candidate at [SPIRAL](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/) @ Northeastern University, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering. I work on developing machine learning algorithms for intent inference from neuromotor signals, designing deep neural networks for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces, and developing real-time EMG-based gesture classification algorithms for Human-Machine Interfaces. 

Check out my recent works [User Training with Error Augmentation for Electromyogram-based Gesture Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07289) and [Recursive Estimation of User Intent From Noninvasive Electroencephalography Using Discriminative Models](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10095715).
