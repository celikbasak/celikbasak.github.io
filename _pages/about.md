Hi there! This is Basak, a third year PhD student at [Cognitive Systems Laboratory](https://web.northeastern.edu/csl/) and [SPIRAL](https://web.northeastern.edu/spiral/). I work on applied machine learning for intent inference from neuromotor signals, deep neural network design for EEG-based Brain-Computer Interfaces, and EMG-based gesture classification for Human-Machine Interfaces. 

Check out my recent work [Feedback Related Potentials for EEG-Based Typing Systems](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2021.788258/full) in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience.
